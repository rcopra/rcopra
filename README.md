# Hi, I'm Rick 👋

## Developer | Problem Solver | Tech Enthusiast

After a rich journey through customer service and global mobility, I've found my passion in coding. A pivotal experience at Le Wagon's bootcamp ignited my love for creating and troubleshooting in the digital space.

### Here's a snapshot of my tech stack:

- **Version Control:** Git
- **Deployment Platforms:** Heroku
- **Frontend Development:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Backend Development:** Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL

I'm currently expanding my horizons by diving deep into the MERN stack. My repositories are a testament to my journey in coding, from custom keyboard layouts to full-stack applications.

Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or chat about tech!
